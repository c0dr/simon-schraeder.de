Hello World! I'm Simon Schraeder, a Computer Science Student (3rd year) and a passionate (web) developer (mostly nodejs + React/Redux).

I'm currently in the process of writing my bacheolor thesis on automated testing of REST API endpoints in an microservice environment. The rest of the time I'm working with my team at T-Systems on an React webservice project.

As you can guess my time to write blog posts is a bit limited at the moment, so I encourage you to check out my few [GitHub projects](https://github.com/c0dr) as well.
