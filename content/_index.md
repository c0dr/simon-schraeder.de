Hello World! I'm Simon Schraeder, a passionate web developer working mostly with Java/NodeJS and React/Vue.

Currently I'm working at Breuninger creating the best-in-class online shop with Java services and cutting-edge frontend technologies.

As you can guess my time to write blog posts is a bit limited at the moment, so I encourage you to check out my few [GitHub projects](https://github.com/c0dr) as well.
