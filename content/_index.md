Hello World! I'm Simon Schraeder, a Computer Science Student (3rd year) and a passionate (web) developer (mostly nodejs + React or vuejs).

My blog is a bit outdated due to limited time, so I encourage you to check out my few [GitHub projects](https://github.com/c0dr) instead.

Thank you for your interest.
