      <description>I was always a little intruigued by the &amp;ldquo;Debugging&amp;rdquo; tab in Visual Studio Code, but didn&amp;rsquo;t really investigate what it could do. Probably debug some Python code, but not the JavaScript I usually work with. Recently though when working on a new React App, I realized I was totally wrong.
It turns out it is actually quite easy to setup and allows debugging of client-side JavaScript applications. You can set breakpoints directly inside your code, which really is a blessing.</description>

      <title>andChill: Building an Alexa Skill with Spotify and Hue</title>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve bought an Amazon Echo Dot as an entry into voice-controlling my home and I quite like it. It reacts fast enough, the voice recognition is good and it works beautifully with my Phillips Hue Lamps.
There is just one thing missing that annoys me: No macros. Often I&amp;rsquo;m coming home late in the evening and just want some music to play and the lights to be turned on. The voice recognicion is good, but it get&amp;rsquo;s tiring to say &amp;ldquo;Alexa, play Spotify playlist evening&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;Alexa, turn on the bedroom lights on scene Evening&amp;rdquo;.</description>

      <title>Let&#39;s Encrypt on Uberspace with Ghost</title>

      <description>I haven&amp;rsquo;t really published a lot of blog posts in a long time due to time constraints and this post will be quite short as well.
Just wanted to give some pointers for people using the awesome webhost Uberspace who want to secure their site with Let&amp;rsquo;s Encrypt, especially when using Ghost. I was using Cloudflare&amp;rsquo;s SSL before, but it felt kind of wrong to have a third-party MITM your requests to serve them over HTTPS.</description>

      <description>A few days ago I took part in the &amp;ldquo;Data MÃ¼nster Hackathon&amp;rdquo;, the kickoff event of a usergroup/meetup here in Muenster. It was a three day long hackaton (1 day of coding), which I won together with a colleague (recieved an iPad Air 2 :) ).
So together with a friend I knew from &amp;ldquo;Code For Muenster&amp;rdquo;, a meetup where we work on open data problems (my projects are on GitHub we decided to work on a logo parser.</description>

      <title>Imgur Redirects Direct Images</title>

      <description>Imgur is a popular hoster for images used on sites like twitter or reddit. To share the imag, you have the choice between using a hotlink to the file or using an url which shows the image along with ads.
But when you use the hotlink on Twitter, it seems like imgur automatically redirects to the website.
I decided to investigate this, which turned out to be quite simple.
First let&amp;rsquo;s see what imgur responds to a normal requests to the file:</description>

      <title>Better UI: Display passwords</title>
      <link>https://simon-schraeder.de/posts/better-ui-display-password/</link>

      <description>Signup for one service and one common thing you&amp;rsquo;ll see is a masked password box. This provides security because bystanders can&amp;rsquo;t read the password. It comes with a downside though: Your user will be annoyed if he makes a typo. This is especially annoying if the password needs to be typed two times to prevent typos and you have to type both passwords again.
But there is a simple solution to this problem: Provide an &amp;ldquo;unmask&amp;rdquo; function.</description>
